    - Quit the game.
    - View their previous guesses in a history board.
    - Use a hint to reveal one secret number.
    The function also includes these features:
    - Secret numbers are generated (via API or locally).
    - Player guesses are validated for edge cases using the parse_guess_line().
    - Player guesses are collected and tracked in the game history.
    - Game results are saved to a database if the player is qualified.
    After the game ends, new options are available: 
    - View the board 'Top 5 winners'
    - Quit the game
